lwjgl project

TODO
	- implement batching of tiles, either with some VAO's or one VAO and change to uv buffer to draw multiple tiles.
	- implement deferred rendering to support many small lights and basic shadows from heightmap
	- for deferred rendering, render at non scaled resolution, and scale as the very last step.

		1. gbuffer rendering:
			normals, depth
			diffuse color, specular color
			- can all be replaced by uv coordinates.

			do we need more than u,v coordinates?
