lwjgl project

TODO
	- implement batching of tiles, either with some VAO's or one VAO and change to uv buffer to draw multiple tiles.
	- implement deferred rendering to support many small lights and basic shadows from heightmap
	- for deferred rendering, render at non scaled resolution, and scale as the very last step.
	- implement light accumulation
	- refactor opengl code. Need strategy to keep opengl objects 
from floating around all over the code.
